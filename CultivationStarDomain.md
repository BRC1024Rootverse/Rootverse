Spirit cultivators focus on nurturing the soul and spiritual power, enhancing their soul strength through resonance with cosmic energy. In the Cultivation Star Domain, every being strives to reach the limits of their own energy, and together they form a mysterious and magnificent world of cultivation, gathering countless dream chasers.
