### Demon Domain 魔域

A truly forbidden territory, this mysterious star system is shrouded in darkness and demonic power. In these distant and isolated planets, the Slaughter Demons and the Fallen Demons reign supreme. The Slaughter Demons are renowned for their unparalleled combat instincts and wild demonic powers, living through interstellar wars and conquests. On the other hand, the Fallen Demons are defined by their aesthetics of decadence and corruption, spreading seeds of temptation and destruction throughout the domain. The sky in the Demon Domain is perpetually oppressive and dark, swallowed by boundless darkness. Space fissures are frequent and perilous, often bringing sudden interstellar storms, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to enter this forbidden land. It is not only the habitat of the Slaughter Demons and Fallen Demons but also the source of their power.

一個名副其實的禁忌領域，是被暗夜與魔力籠罩的神秘星系。在這些遙遠而孤立的星球上，戮魔族和堕魔族構成了這片星域的主宰。戮魔族，以其無比的戰鬥本能和狂野的魔力而著稱，他們在星際間征戰，以戰爭和征服為生。而堕魔族，則被他們沉淪與堕落的美學所定義，他們在這個星域中播散著誘惑與毀滅的種子。魔域的天空永遠顯得壓抑而陰暗，被無邊的黑暗所吞噬。這裡的空間裂縫頻繁且危險，常常引來突如其來的星際風暴，使得外來生物幾乎無法踏入這片禁地。它不僅是戮魔族和堕魔族的棲息之所，更是他們力量的源泉。
