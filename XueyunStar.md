### Xueyun Star
- **Eternal Frost City**: The capital of Xueyun Star, covered in ice and snow throughout the year. The high city walls are built from thick blocks of ice, and the buildings within are constructed using special ice and snow techniques, making them crystal clear.
- **Icebound Holy Tower**: Located in the center of Eternal Frost City, this tower is a sacred place for ascetics to practice. Inside the tower, there are ice sculptures of Buddha, ancient scriptures, and frosty magical treasures, representing the mysterious fusion of ice and snow.
- **Frost Forest**: Situated in the northwest of the planet, this is a vast evergreen forest. Despite the perennial snowfall, the creatures here have special abilities to adapt to the cold, representing life's adaptability and resilience.
- **Cold Wind Valley**: Located in the southern part of the planet, this area consists of canyons. Due to the wind tunnels formed by the canyons, it is perpetually windy here.
- **Frozen Soul Lake**: Found north of Eternal Frost City, the lake's surface is frozen year-round, only breaking open on specific days to reveal the water beneath. It is said that deep within the lake exists a magical plant known as the "Ice Soul Flower," which absorbs moonlight and emits a faint blue light at night, adding a touch of mystery to the frozen lake surface.
