### Destiny Wheel Star
- **Wheel of Destiny**: The core landmark of Destiny Wheel Star is the colossal Wheel of Destiny, situated at the planet's center. This structure serves both as a symbol and a functional facility, housing intricate mechanical and magical mechanisms designed to reveal and influence the flow of fate.
- **Prophets' Valley**: Near the Wheel of Destiny lies a deep valley inhabited by the planet's prophets and astrologers. This area is filled with observatories and divination chambers where prophets interpret the flow of destiny through stargazing and mysterious rituals.
- **Divine Lake**: Located in the eastern part of Destiny Wheel Star, this crystal-clear lake is believed to have the magical ability to foresee the future. Along the lakeside, there are multiple meditation pavilions where individuals can reflect and seek inner guidance.
- **Gates of Choice**: In the northern region of the planet, an area known as the Gates of Choice features rows of massive stone gates, each representing different destiny choices. This is a crucial trial ground where novice prophets must pass the tests of the Gates of Choice to prove their foresight abilities.
- **Library of Destiny**: South of the Wheel of Destiny lies a vast library, storing theories of cosmic fate and historical records. This library serves as both a place of learning and research and a treasure trove for uncovering clues about destiny.
