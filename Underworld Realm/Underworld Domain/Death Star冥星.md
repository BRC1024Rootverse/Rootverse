## Death Star
- **City of Silence**: Located in the east, this is a massive tomb city themed around silence and death. Zombies and skeletons wander aimlessly here. The city is designed as a maze, making it easy to enter but difficult to leave. At the center of the city is a spot from which mist continually spreads, forming the core of the City of Silence. The city's architecture features towering spires and crumbling walls.
- **Spectral Swamp**: Situated in the west, this swamp emits a faint blue-white glow, which is especially visible at night. The swamp is surrounded by mist-covered hills of silence, with strange luminescent plants growing on them, providing the only natural light source. Legends say the spring water in the swamp has the power to resurrect the dead, but it also harbors great dangers.
- **Plain of Despair**: Located in the central northern area, this is an endless wasteland where the wind howls and signs of life are nearly nonexistent. Scattered across the plain are ancient stone tablets inscribed with unknown symbols, seemingly recording some ancient prophecy.
- **Ancient Tower of Darkness**: Positioned northwest of the City of Silence, this isolated tower is surrounded by weathered ancient stone tombs. Inside the tower are layered chambers filled with various ancient magic circles and forbidden knowledge. The top floor houses an observatory from which, on certain special nights, one can glimpse sights from other planets.
- **Nether Court**: Located in the southeastern corner of the Plain of Despair, this is a vast courtyard built from black stone. The architectural style and sculptures here express a worship and acceptance of death. In the center of the courtyard is a dark fountain, carved with various ghostly figures. The water in the fountain is black and constantly bubbling with tiny bubbles. It is said that the water can connect to an unknown dark realm.
- **River of Styx**:In the southern region, this river runs through the entire Abyssal Star, with dark and icy waters, flanked by withered trees and thorns. The River of Styx is considered the only passage to the depths of the Netherworld, with its banks filled with legendary spirits of the dead. Ferries are the only safe means of crossing the river, and the ferrymen are among the most mysterious figures on the Abyssal Star.
- **Hades Palace**:This is the most sacred place on the Abyssal Star, located at the end of the River of Styx. Hades Palace is a magnificent structure made of black marble, adorned with countless night jewels. The ruler of the Abyssal Star resides here, holding the power over life and death on the entire planet.
- **Spring of Souls**:A mysterious spring hidden deep within the Spectral Swamp, it is said to absorb and store the souls of the dead. The water is a pale blue and shimmers with a faint light, believed to have miraculous healing powers.


## 冥星
### 死寂之城
東部，一個巨大的墳墓城市，以寂靜和死亡為氛圍主題。僵屍和骷髏在此漫無目的地徘徊，城市被設計成一座迷宮，易進難出；城市中央有一個不斷擴散迷霧的地點，是死寂之城的核心。城市中的建築以高聳的尖塔和斷壁殘垣為特色。

### 幽魂沼澤
西部，這片沼澤散發著微弱的藍白色光芒，夜晚尤為明顯。沼澤四周是被迷霧包裹的死寂丘陵，丘陵上生長著奇異的熒光植物，提供了唯一的自然光源。傳說沼澤中的泉水有復活死者的能力，但也隱藏著巨大的危險。

### 絕望平原
中央偏北地帶，這裡是一片永無止境的荒地，風聲呼嘯，幾乎沒有任何生命跡象。平原上散布著古老的石碑，上面刻著未知的文字，似乎記錄著某種古老的預言。

### 黯靈古塔
坐落在死寂之城的西北方，是一座孤立的高塔，周圍是被風化的古舊石墓。塔內是一個個層層疊疊的密室，每一層都充滿了各種古老的魔法陣和禁忌知識的書籍。頂層是一個觀星台，據說在某些特殊的夜晚，可以窺視到其他星球的景象。

### 幽冥聖庭
位於絕望平原的東南角，是一個由黑色石材建造的龐大庭院。這裡的建築風格和雕塑均表現出一種對死亡的崇拜和接納。庭院的中央是一座雕有各種鬼魂形象的黑暗泉池，水池的水是黑色的，且永不枯竭。

### 冥河
南部地區，這條河流貫穿整個冥星，河水黝黑且冰冷，兩岸長滿了枯樹和荊棘。冥河被認為是通向冥界深處的唯一通道，沿岸布滿了傳說中的亡靈。渡船是唯一能夠安全穿越冥河的工具，河上的擺渡人則是冥星上最神秘的角色之一。

### 冥王殿
這是冥星上最神聖的場所，位於冥河的盡頭。冥王殿是一座宏偉壯麗的建築，內部由黑色大理石構成，裝飾著無數的暗夜寶石。冥星的統治者居住在此，控制著整個星球的生死大權。

### 靈魂之泉
一處隱藏在幽魂沼澤深處的神秘泉水，傳說能夠吸收並儲存亡靈的靈魂。泉水呈淡藍色，閃爍著微弱的光芒，據說擁有神奇的療愈能力。
