The Underworld Domain represents the boundary between life and death, symbolizing the inevitability of death, the eternal, and the hope of rebirth. This eerie and mysterious star system is composed of numerous planets, each shrouded in desolation and dimness. Within this vast cosmic domain, the Zombie Tribe and the Skeleton Tribe are the eternal inhabitants of this dark star field. The Zombie Tribe is known for their insatiable longing for death and relentless pursuit of life. They wander the Nether Realm, seemingly searching for some lost meaning of life. The Skeleton Tribe, on the other hand, is another peculiar existence in this star field. Their hollow forms and deep eye sockets mark them as the star fieldâ€™s guardians who invade other planets under the guise of protectors. In the sky of the Nether Realm, the light of the stars appears particularly dim. Life here seems to have lost its typical meaning, becoming a deeper state of existence. Due to the uniqueness of this star field, external creatures rarely enter, as the environment is extremely harsh, filled with the aura of death and decay. The inhabitants of the Nether Realm have developed a powerful adaptability and unique acclimatization to the dark environment, establishing an ecosystem that operates under different rules. In this star field, death is not an end but a cyclical beginning. Zombies and skeletons exhibit a peculiar way of life in this dark corner of the universe.
