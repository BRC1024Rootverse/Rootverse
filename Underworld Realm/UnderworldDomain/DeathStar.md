### Death Star
- **City of Silence**: Located in the east, this is a massive tomb city themed around silence and death. Zombies and skeletons wander aimlessly here. The city is designed as a maze, making it easy to enter but difficult to leave. At the center of the city is a spot from which mist continually spreads, forming the core of the City of Silence. The city's architecture features towering spires and crumbling walls.
- **Spectral Swamp**: Situated in the west, this swamp emits a faint blue-white glow, which is especially visible at night. The swamp is surrounded by mist-covered hills of silence, with strange luminescent plants growing on them, providing the only natural light source. Legends say the spring water in the swamp has the power to resurrect the dead, but it also harbors great dangers.
- **Plain of Despair**: Located in the central northern area, this is an endless wasteland where the wind howls and signs of life are nearly nonexistent. Scattered across the plain are ancient stone tablets inscribed with unknown symbols, seemingly recording some ancient prophecy.
- **Ancient Tower of Darkness**: Positioned northwest of the City of Silence, this isolated tower is surrounded by weathered ancient stone tombs. Inside the tower are layered chambers filled with various ancient magic circles and forbidden knowledge. The top floor houses an observatory from which, on certain special nights, one can glimpse sights from other planets.
- **Nether Court**: Located in the southeastern corner of the Plain of Despair, this is a vast courtyard built from black stone. The architectural style and sculptures here express a worship and acceptance of death. In the center of the courtyard is a dark fountain, carved with various ghostly figures. The water in the fountain is black and constantly bubbling with tiny bubbles. It is said that the water can connect to an unknown dark realm.
