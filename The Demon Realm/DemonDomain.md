A truly forbidden territory, this mysterious star system is shrouded in darkness and demonic power. In these distant and isolated planets, the Slaughter Demons and the Fallen Demons reign supreme. The Slaughter Demons are renowned for their unparalleled combat instincts and wild demonic powers, living through interstellar wars and conquests. On the other hand, the Fallen Demons are defined by their aesthetics of decadence and corruption, spreading seeds of temptation and destruction throughout the domain. The sky in the Demon Domain is perpetually oppressive and dark, swallowed by boundless darkness. Space fissures are frequent and perilous, often bringing sudden interstellar storms, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to enter this forbidden land. It is not only the habitat of the Slaughter Demons and Fallen Demons but also the source of their power.
