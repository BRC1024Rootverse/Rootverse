### Abyssal Star
- **Demon City**: Located in the northwest, this is the territory of the Slaughter Demons. The city is dry and desolate, set in a barren landscape. Its buildings are primarily constructed from obsidian and rock. The area around the city is covered in thick ash, creating an oppressive and powerful visual impact.
- **Shadow Tower City**: Situated in the central region, this city is built over a massive fissure, perpetually shrouded in a layer of dark clouds with dim lighting. The towering spires symbolize the Fallen Demons' pursuit of power and desire for conquest. The Gothic-style palace with its spires and eerie decorations serves as a warning to outsiders.
- **Abyss of Shadows**: Located in the north, this is a bottomless trench believed to be a gateway to the underworld. Legend has it that on full moon nights, strange lights emanate from the abyss.
- **Endless Canyon**: In the south, this winding and twisting canyon stretches for thousands of miles. It is the place where the Fallen Demons and the Slaughter Demons abandon their failures. The canyon hides unknown dangers and forgotten ancient secrets.
- **Netherwood**: In the southwest, this vast forest is a labyrinthine expanse covered in thick fog with twisted trees that block out the sky. Deeper within the forest lies the legendary "Spring of Souls," whose waters are said to possess incredible healing and power-enhancing properties.
