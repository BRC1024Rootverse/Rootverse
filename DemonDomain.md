A truly forbidden territory, this mysterious star system is shrouded in darkness and demonic power. In these distant and isolated planets, the Slaughter Demons and the Fallen Demons reign supreme. The Slaughter Demons are renowned for their unparalleled combat instincts and wild demonic powers, living through interstellar wars and conquests. On the other hand, the Fallen Demons are defined by their aesthetics of decadence and corruption, spreading seeds of temptation and destruction throughout the domain. The sky in the Demon Domain is perpetually oppressive and dark, swallowed by boundless darkness. Space fissures are frequent and perilous, often bringing sudden interstellar storms, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to enter this forbidden land. It is not only the habitat of the Slaughter Demons and Fallen Demons but also the source of their power.

### Abyssal Star
- **Demon City**: Located in the northwest, this is the territory of the Slaughter Demons. The city is dry and desolate, set in a barren landscape. Its buildings are primarily constructed from obsidian and rock. The area around the city is covered in thick ash, creating an oppressive and powerful visual impact.
- **Shadow Tower City**: Situated in the central region, this city is built over a massive fissure, perpetually shrouded in a layer of dark clouds with dim lighting. The towering spires symbolize the Fallen Demons' pursuit of power and desire for conquest. The Gothic-style palace with its spires and eerie decorations serves as a warning to outsiders.
- **Abyss of Shadows**: Located in the north, this is a bottomless trench believed to be a gateway to the underworld. Legend has it that on full moon nights, strange lights emanate from the abyss.
- **Endless Canyon**: In the south, this winding and twisting canyon stretches for thousands of miles. It is the place where the Fallen Demons and the Slaughter Demons abandon their failures. The canyon hides unknown dangers and forgotten ancient secrets.
- **Netherwood**: In the southwest, this vast forest is a labyrinthine expanse covered in thick fog with twisted trees that block out the sky. Deeper within the forest lies the legendary "Spring of Souls," whose waters are said to possess incredible healing and power-enhancing properties.
