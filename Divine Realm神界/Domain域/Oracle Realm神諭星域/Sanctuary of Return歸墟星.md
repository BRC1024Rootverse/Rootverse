## 歸墟星 
### 歷史長河 
蜿蜒穿過星球中央，從西向東流動流經整個星球，河水不僅清澈見底，而且記載著神族的歷史和記憶。河岸邊建有許多紀念碑和雕塑，每一件作品都代表神族的一個重要歷史事件。

### 回響平原 
星球南部，一個開闊的平原區域，風吹過時會帶起低沉的回響，據說這些聲音是過去神族英雄的回聲。這裡設有眾多的神族英雄紀念館和歷史博物館，用以紀念和學習過去的教訓。

### 終極聖所 
東北部，歸墟星的中心，一處被高度尊重和保護的區域，只有經過特別許可的神族才能進入。這裡藏有神族所有已故成員的靈魂精華，是一個充滿神聖和寧靜氛圍的修煉與反思場所。

### 寧靜林 
西部，一片巨大的森林，裡面生長著數千年的古樹，每一棵樹都被認為是一個獨立的歷史見證者。森林中有許多隱蔽的小徑和休息區，供神族成員在尋求內心平靜和靈感時使用。
