# Multiverse Domain


The name "Multiverse Domain" itself is filled with the symbolism of the cosmic center and the diversity of life. It is a grand domain where numerous planets converge, showcasing the diversity and vitality of life. In this star domain, the divine races guard the order with their wisdom and power; the industrious and creative human races thrive in every corner of the domain; the mysterious Forest People live unobtrusively in dense interstellar forests; innovative technologists harness the power of the universe with cutting-edge technology to modify environments; and the wandering Star People traverse the cosmos, communicating with it in their unique way. This "domain" serves as an open cosmic junction whose boundaries are open to all creatures across star domains, making it the universeâ€™s largest melting pot. Here, a myriad of life forms coexist, and diverse cultures, knowledge, and technologies intertwine, fostering countless possibilities. It is the richness of the Multiverse Domain that prompts some powerful races to explore and attempt to encroach on other domains.
